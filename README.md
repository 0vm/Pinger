# Pinger
A Fast IP Pinger, An Open source IP Pinger that can log downtime, can ping URL's, IPv4 and IPv6.
If this gets enough attention i'll make a linux version.



# Features
* Pings the host right after it recieves a response, rapidly pinging the host, this cannot be used to dos as that is a obsolete method.
* Ability to log each timeout with a timestamp right beside it making a new line per timeout
* Now shows when it times out (original didn't)
* Title Loops Through Different Texts, Has a built in time counter, to show how long you have been pinging / had the application open.
* Shows the timeouts on the title bar, for easy access and for overnight monitoring.
* Ability to ping: IPv4, URL's and IPv6(if your ISP gives you an address).
* Timeout is set to 1.5 seconds just to remove the possibility of a false positive timeout, though it may still occur



# Uses To This
* Can be used as a downtime checker for something that is not very important. (For something more important I would recommend having a cronjob on your server making a request every minute to check if it is down and to run a pcap to see if it a ddos attack or some sort of exploit)
* Can show timestamps of when your internet goes down incase your isp requires evidence.
* Can show when the IP you are pinging goes down or spikes to see if your friend is actually lagging or if they just suck. 
* Honestly a lot more, i just cant name them its currently 1:16am and i feel like dying inside.
